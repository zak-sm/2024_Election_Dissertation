# Ethnic Voting Behavior and Foreign Policy  
### Arab-American Electoral Shifts in Response to MENA Region Conflict

---

## Project Background  
This project investigates the quantitative impact of foreign policy shocks on domestic electoral behavior among ethnic minority communities in the United States. We focus specifically on Arab-American voters in Michigan during the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election.

## Executive Summary

### Scope of Analysis  
We analyze precinct-level election data, including vote shares, turnout rates, and third-party performance across election years. Our primary focus is Arab-concentrated municipalities in Michigan—Dearborn, Dearborn Heights, and Hamtramck—compared to a demographically similar but ethnically dissimilar control group: Dane County, Wisconsin.

### Control Group Justification  
Dane County was selected as a control due to its comparable political alignment, urban density, and educational profile, but with minimal Arab-American population. This distinction enables us to isolate the effect of foreign policy salience within Arab communities.

### Key Findings  
- In 2024, Dearborn (Arab population ~47%) experienced a 1300% increase in third-party vote share, rising from 605 votes in 2020 to 8,359 in 2024.  
- Democratic support in Arab-majority cities dropped by over 50% compared to 2020.  
- An estimated 8–11% of voters shifted directly from the Democratic ticket to the Republican candidate.  
- Dane County, by contrast, saw virtually no shift in third-party voting (+0.01%).  

### Strategic Recommendations  
- Conduct localized polling to assess ethnic group vulnerability to foreign policy backlash in swing states.  
- Adapt foreign policy messaging to acknowledge diaspora concerns and avoid binary, zero-sum narratives.  
- Prioritize outreach to ethnic community leaders before and during major global conflicts.  
- Develop rapid-response communications tailored for diaspora-heavy districts during foreign policy crises.

## Insights Deep Dive

### Demographic Context  
- Michigan has the highest proportion of Arab-Americans in the U.S., at approximately 3.87% (over 390,000 residents).  
- Dearborn alone is nearly 47% Arab-American, making it a key political bellwether.

### Foreign Policy Salience and Attention  
- Google Trends data following the October 7 Gaza escalation show spikes in searches for “Palestine” and “Gaza” in Arab-majority cities in Michigan.  
- No comparable attention shift occurred in Dane County, suggesting localized salience linked to cultural identity.

### Electoral Impact  
- Dearborn’s third-party vote share increased from 1.35% in 2020 to 16.6% in 2024.  
- Arab precincts across Michigan saw an estimated 16-point increase in third-party share.  
- Turnout dropped only slightly (~6–8%) in Arab-majority cities, suggesting vote-switching rather than abstention.  
- Dane County saw stable turnout and vote distributions.

### DiD Results  
- Difference-in-Difference (DiD) regression shows an interaction effect of +0.158 (p < 0.001).  
- Model is robust to HC1/HC2 standard error adjustments and continuous Arab population specifications.  
- Adjusted R² = 0.995 indicates excellent model fit.

## Recommendations for Campaign Strategy and Policy Design

1. Develop a foreign policy-to-diaspora mapping framework to identify potential political vulnerabilities.  
2. Fund community-led forums in key diaspora-heavy cities to surface political concerns.  
3. Treat ethnic-majority districts as strategic zones requiring specialized communication and outreach.  
4. Invest in culturally aligned media infrastructure to disseminate campaign narratives effectively.  
5. Use early indicators (e.g., localized search volume spikes) as predictive tools for voter disaffection.

## Clarifying Questions, Assumptions, and Caveats

### Assumptions  
- Demographic clustering is a valid proxy for voter identity salience.  
- The 2024 Gaza conflict was the primary foreign policy event influencing behavior.  
- Dane County is appropriately insulated from these identity-linked effects.

### Caveats  
- Small sample size (8 cities).  
- Localized ballot dynamics not captured (focus is solely presidential voting).  
- Third-party votes may reflect a range of motives (protest, strategy, disaffection).

### Future Research  
- Incorporate social media sentiment analysis from platforms like Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram.  
- Expand study to include Arab-American populations in Minnesota, Illinois, and California.  
- Explore downstream effects in midterms and state-level elections.
