Project Title: Ethnic Voting Behavior and Foreign Policy: Arab-American Electoral Shifts in Response to MENA Region Conflict
 
Project Background

This project investigates the quantitative impact of foreign policy shocks on domestic electoral behavior among ethnic minority communities in the United States, focusing on Arab-American voters in Michigan during the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election.
 
Executive Summary
Scope of Analysis: We conduct a quantitative analysis of precinct-level electoral data, including vote shares, turnout, and third-party performance across election years. Our focal point is Arab-concentrated municipalities in Michigan (Dearborn, Dearborn Heights, and Hamtramck) contrasted with a demographically similar but ethnically dissimilar control group: Dane County, Wisconsin.

Control Group Justification: Dane County was selected as the control due to its progressive political alignment, urban density, and socio-educational comparability, yet with minimal Arab-American presence. This allows us to isolate the impact of identity-linked foreign policy shocks on Arab-majority communities.

Key Findings:
•	In 2024, Dearborn (with an Arab population share of ~47%) saw a 1300% increase in third-party vote share (from 605 to 8,359 votes), while Democratic support dropped by over 50% from 2020 levels.
•	The control group (Dane County) showed negligible third-party shift (+0.01%) during the same period.
•	Roughly 8–11% of voters in Dearborn precincts appear to have migrated directly from Democratic ballots to Republican, but the overwhelming pivot was toward third-party protest voting.

Strategic Recommendations:
1.	Micro-targeted ethnic group polling in swing states to detect vulnerability to foreign policy-induced disillusionment.
2.	Foreign policy narrative framing: Avoid zero-sum alignments; instead, adopt rhetoric that acknowledges diaspora concerns.
3.	Strategic outreach prior to conflict escalation, including relationship-building with local ethnic leaders.
4.	Rapid-response messaging teams to deploy nuanced foreign policy stances during active international crises.

 
Insights Deep Dive

Demographic Context:
•	Michigan has the highest proportion of Arab-Americans nationwide (~3.87%), totaling over 390,000 residents.
•	Dearborn alone holds ~47% Arab population—acting as a cultural and political bellwether for Arab-American sentiment.

Foreign Policy Salience and Attention Shifts:
•	Following the October 7th conflict escalation in Gaza, Google Trends data indicates a spike in Palestine/Gaza-related searches in Michigan—specifically Dearborn, Dearborn Heights, and Hamtramck.
•	Comparative attention data from Wisconsin shows minimal increase in foreign-policy-related search activity.

Electoral Impact Metrics:
•	Dearborn: Third-party vote share grew from 1.35% in 2020 to 16.6% in 2024.
•	Dane County: Minimal third-party growth (0.01%) despite similar baseline educational and age composition.
•	Arab precincts statewide: Estimated 16 percentage point increase in third-party vote share based on DiD regression analysis.
•	Turnout contraction in Arab-majority cities: ~6–8%, indicating vote-switching rather than abstention.

Control vs. Treatment Comparison (DiD Results):
•	DiD regression shows statistically significant interaction coefficient (DiD = +0.158; p < 0.001).
•	Model robustness confirmed using HC1/HC2 estimators and continuous % Arab specifications.
•	R^2 = 0.995 indicates high model fit.
 
Recommendations for Campaign Strategy & Policy Design

1.	Foreign Policy Mapping to Diaspora Communities: Establish predictive links between global regions of interest and U.S. ethnic constituencies.
2.	Community-led Listening Sessions: Empower local civic leaders in diaspora-rich areas to communicate voter priorities ahead of elections.
3.	Policy Modulation Zones: Treat ethnic-dense municipalities as zones requiring tailored political messaging.
4.	Invest in Identity-Aligned Communication Channels: Utilize culturally relevant media (e.g., Arabic-language radio) to preemptively address voter concerns.
5.	Early Warning Systems for Salience Spikes: Monitor digital sentiment signals (e.g., localized search terms) to flag brewing political risks.
 
Clarifying Questions, Assumptions, and Caveats

•	Assumptions:
o	Voters are accurately represented by demographic clustering.
o	2024 Gaza conflict is the dominant shock impacting Arab-American voting behavior.
o	Control group is sufficiently insulated from identity-linked salience effects.

•	Caveats:
o	Limited sample size (N = 8 cities).
o	Potential unobserved variables (e.g., localized campaign events, non-Presidential ballot dynamics).
o	Third-party vote tallies do not always reflect uniform ideological preference (may include protest, strategic, or disaffected votes).

•	Future Research:
o	Incorporate sentiment analysis from social media.
o	Expand analysis to include Minnesota, Wisconsin, and other Arab-American dense states.
o	Explore longitudinal impacts in midterm cycles.
